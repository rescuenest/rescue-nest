# Rescue Nest Project Help

🐶 **A Message from the Heart – Help Us Build Rescue Nest**

Hello to all of you with hearts as deep as the ocean 💚

We live in a country where stray dogs 🐕 — the most loyal and loving creatures on Earth — are treated as pests. They have no rights, no protection, and no value in the eyes of the system. There is no official organization that defends animals here. Instead, stray dogs are brutally killed just to reduce their numbers in the cities. From gunshots to acid injections, the suffering is beyond words. Some people even kill them for a tiny amount of money. Many are tortured for fun. The things we have seen and heard would break any human’s heart.

My three close friends and I couldn’t bear it anymore. So we decided to do something real: to build a safe haven, a true sanctuary, a home for 500 stray dogs. 🏡

But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to give these beautiful souls a second chance at life. 🙏 We have prepared a basic list of supplies and space that such a shelter needs. This is just the beginning — if we can raise even a portion of the cost, we will do the rest with our own hands.

💔 Due to international sanctions, we have no access to PayPal or any global banking. The only way we can receive help is through cryptocurrency wallet addresses listed below.

If you are reading this, you have the power to make a real change. Even a small donation — or simply sharing this message — can save lives.

They deserve better. Let’s be their voice. Thank you for caring. 🐾
